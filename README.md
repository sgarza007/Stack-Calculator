# Stack-Calculator
This project was designed to use stack to calculate an infix expression. We first needed to convert the infix expression into postfix version by pushing and popping using stack. Then, that postfix expression was used to calculate by pushing and popping as well. I used a stack of type Object so that I could use the same stack for both converting and evaluation.
